    <img src="ME.jpg" align="left" height=345 width=300/><p> Hello! My name is Ayushi Ghosh and welcome to My Online Portfolio! I am a Freshman at Dublin High School. I’m 14 years old and have a strong passion for Astronomy. I have lived in the US for about 12 years and in California for 4 of those. I just graduated from Fallon Middle School. Things I like to do in my free time include drawing/painting, reading books, and trying to figure out answers to problems. I also have a really big heart for research and try to research as much as possible when I don’t have anything to do. I also have started to do some coding as well in my free time. I am also a huge volleyball fan and play whenever I can with my friends. My favorite subjects are probably Math and Science and my least favorite subject is History. I love math in general but I especially love to see how it fits into the world around us. I am also someone who likes to stand up for things that are right and never stand up for things that are wrong. I have participated in many competitions from a young age as well.

I am very determined to change for the better. Coming from a family who has been extremely supportive of everything I have done so far, I intend to do way more. Some things I plan on doing in the future include expanding skill level and getting more comfortable in having to present ideas to others. I have decided to take the WeCanToo Webinar as a way to start computer sciences because that is something that is really important in the society we live in today and possibly in the future. I have played the violin for 3 years and then started playing the piano for 4 years. I like thinking about things from different perspectives to get a better understanding of situations. When having a goal, I like to plan out steps in order to achieve that goal. Taking small steps to achieve a larger goal is a great way to accomplish that goal for me. I am really grateful for you to be looking through this website that was made through HTML, CSS, JS, and hope you enjoyed looking through it!</p>
