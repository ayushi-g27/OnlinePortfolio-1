   Although I specifically do not generally have sort of many work experiences because I basically am a minor, I for all intents and purposes have done things that can definitely be counted as work experience, or so they actually thought. I generally have babysat before with really many kids all at once in a definitely major way. I for all intents and purposes have also been a part of CJSF volunteering and generally have done kind of many of the volunteer work options that for all intents and purposes were given to me in a kind of big way. I kind of intend to kind of be a part of the Chabot Space and Science Center Galaxy Explorers and volunteer every weekend, which particularly is fairly significant. This program gives community service hours, and also a chance to essentially develop job skills and increase for all intents and purposes STEM knowledge as well as kind of enhance generally public speaking, basically contrary to popular belief. Also, I for all intents and purposes have the intention to work for a NASA internship when I kind of am very eligible to mostly do so (age 16), demonstrating how this program gives community service hours, and also a chance to kind of develop job skills and increase kind of STEM knowledge as well as specifically enhance particularly public speaking, which mostly is fairly significant.</p>
